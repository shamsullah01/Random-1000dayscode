# Fullstack Roadmap: React (Frontend) + NestJS (Backend)

This concise roadmap will take you from basics to job-ready fullstack developer using React for frontend and NestJS for backend. Follow the weekly plan, build the projects, and pass the quality gates.

## Goal
Become capable of designing, building, testing, and deploying production-ready fullstack web applications using React and NestJS.

## Timeline (12 weeks)
- Weeks 1–3: JavaScript & TypeScript, React fundamentals
- Weeks 4–6: Advanced React (hooks, router, testing), styling, performance
- Weeks 7–9: Node.js & NestJS core, DB integration, auth
- Weeks 10–11: Fullstack integration, deployment, CI/CD, Docker
- Week 12: Polish portfolio, interview prep, mock interviews

## Milestones
1. JavaScript & TypeScript basics — types, async, modules
2. React app — Todo with routing and tests
3. Advanced React — state mgmt, data fetching, performance
4. NestJS API — Users CRUD, validation, auth, DB migrations
5. Fullstack deployed app — CI, Docker, environment config
6. Extras — real-time, background jobs, monitoring

## Weekly Plan (what to do)
Week 1 — JS + TypeScript
- Learn ES6+ features, async/await, map/filter/reduce
- Learn TypeScript basics: types, interfaces, generics
- Exercise: Convert a small JS module to TypeScript

Week 2 — React basics
- Learn JSX, components, props, state
- Build: Simple Todo app (local state)
- Exercise: Deploy to Vercel/Netlify

Week 3 — Hooks & Routing
- Learn useState/useEffect/useRef/custom hooks
- Learn React Router v6
- Add persistence (localStorage) and tests (React Testing Library)

Week 4 — Styling & Components
- Learn CSS Modules, Tailwind or Styled Components
- Build a small component library

Week 5 — State & Data Fetching
- Learn useContext/useReducer, Zustand or Redux basics
- Learn React Query (TanStack Query) for server state
- Connect to a mock API

Week 6 — Performance & Testing
- Optimize with memo/useMemo/useCallback
- Add unit & integration tests

Week 7 — Node & NestJS intro
- Learn Node basics and NestJS architecture
- Scaffold Nest app and simple endpoints

Week 8 — Database & Auth
- Choose Prisma (recommended) or TypeORM
- Implement Users CRUD, migrations, and JWT auth

Week 9 — NestJS advanced
- DTOs, validation, pipes, guards, interceptors
- Unit tests for services/controllers

Week 10 — Fullstack integration
- Connect React to Nest API
- Implement login, protected routes, form handling

Week 11 — Deployment & CI
- Dockerize frontend & backend
- Add GitHub Actions: build, lint, test
- Deploy backend (Render/Heroku/Azure) and frontend (Vercel)

Week 12 — Polish & Interviews
- Add README, deploy links, demo video
- Study common interview questions for React & NestJS
- Do mock interviews and practice algorithms

## Projects (portfolio)
- Mini: Todo app (React)
- Intermediate: Users CRUD (React + NestJS + Prisma)
- Advanced: Real-time dashboard (WebSockets) or e-commerce prototype

## Quality Gates (per project)
- Build passes and app runs locally
- Linting & TypeScript checks pass
- Unit tests + at least one e2e test pass
- CI pipeline configured (build, lint, test)
- Dockerfile and deploy instructions in README

## Interview Prep Checklist
Frontend
- React hooks, context, router, lifecycles
- Performance optimization and testing
Backend
- NestJS modules, DI, middleware, guards, validation
- DB modeling, migrations, transactions
System Design
- Rate limiting, caching, scaling strategies
Algorithms
- Arrays, strings, hash maps, trees, two-pointer

## Useful Resources
- React official docs: https://react.dev/
- NestJS docs: https://docs.nestjs.com/
- Prisma docs: https://www.prisma.io/docs/
- React Testing Library, Jest docs
- FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, Frontend Masters for deeper courses

## Next Steps (I can do)
- Scaffold Users CRUD starter (Prisma recommended) with README, Dockerfile, and tests
- Create step-by-step exercise files for Weeks 1–3
- Add GitHub Actions templates for CI

Pick an item above and I will scaffold it now (recommended: Users CRUD scaffold with Prisma).
